### **Purpose**
This repository it's a personal practice of different algorithms and will all be written in **Python**.
Some of the algorithms to learn here will be Search Trees, math algorithms such as Jaccard, and also
optimized algorithms for some code problems such as Manacher Algorithm[ยน].


### **TODO**
- [x] DFS Algorithm
- [x] Jaccard Algorithm
- [x] 2nd Grade Ecuation + Discriminant
- [x] Binary Search
- [x] Recursive Factorial
- [ ] Longer Palindromic Substring

---
[ยน]: *Naive* algorithm will also be reviewed under **Longer Palindromic Substring** folder next to Manacher's.
